Inventory Optimizer API - Cloud + FastAPI

üåç Overview

This project is a production-ready API application that calculates Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for inventory management. It demonstrates a complete workflow from backend development using FastAPI, containerization with Docker, deployment on AWS EC2, CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, and added layers of security and logging.

üí° Use Case

Industrial Context: In inventory-heavy industries, calculating EOQ helps minimize total inventory cost. This API takes demand, ordering cost, and holding cost as inputs and returns EOQ.

‚öñÔ∏è Tech Stack & Tools

1. FastAPI

Lightweight Python web framework for building APIs.

Used for defining endpoints and processing EOQ calculations.

2. Docker

Containerizes the application for consistent environment across development and production.

Ensures portability and easy deployment.

3. AWS EC2

Cloud server hosting the Docker container.

Offers full control over OS and environment.

4. NGINX (optional)

Reverse proxy server to handle incoming HTTP requests.

Can later be used for SSL termination and load balancing.

5. GitHub Actions

Automates deployment process upon pushing to the main branch.

Connects GitHub repo to EC2 server using SSH keys.

6. Logging

Captures each API request with input and output.

Useful for monitoring and debugging.

7. API Key Authentication

Adds a security layer to restrict API access.

Simple header-based token check.

üìÇ File Structure

inventory_api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # FastAPI app with endpoints and logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile           # Build instructions for Docker image
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.log              # Log file generated by logging module

‚öñÔ∏è API Endpoints

GET /ping

Health check for the API

Requires x-api-key in headers

POST /eoq

Accepts: order_cost, demand, holding_cost (float values)

Returns: Calculated EOQ

Secured with API Key

‚ö° Deployment Workflow

1. Local Dev

Run with uvicorn main:app --reload

Test endpoints on localhost

2. Dockerization

docker build -t inventory-api .
docker run -p 80:80 inventory-api

3. AWS EC2 Setup

Launch Ubuntu instance

Install Docker

Open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)

Upload code using scp or git clone

4. CI/CD via GitHub Actions

GitHub workflow file pulls code to EC2

Rebuilds Docker image

Restarts container on every push to main

üìä Future Add-Ons

PostgreSQL for storing request history

Streamlit UI for easier access

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

SSL with Let's Encrypt

Advanced auth (OAuth2/JWT)
